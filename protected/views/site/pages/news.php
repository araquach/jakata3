<h2>Get to know the team: Meet Natalie</h2>
<p>This month we took some time out to ask Natalie Doxey some questions about her career as a stylist at Jakata</p>
<p>We found out how she got into hairdressing, her strengths and weaknesses plus her favourite hairdressing looks for Spring and Summer</p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<dl>
	<dt>So Natalie, how long have you been hairdressing for now?</dt>
	<dd>I've been a qualified hairdresser for about 2 years now but I've been doing it for about 5 years altogether.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I joined the Jakata team back in October 2008 as Saturday staff and continued to do all my training in house.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I have always found the hair and beauty industry fascinating, so I got myself an apprenticeship with Jakata and never looked back. </dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>If I was to do any other job I would be an events organiser, I love planning and co-ordinating things.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>Jakata is amazing for developing new stylists as they really focus on your weaknesses and polish every last skill up to a high standard. It was such an amazing environment to learn in and an even better one now being on the shop floor full time.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>I absolutely love all styles, but for me the most iconic is Frankie Sandford from the Saturdays ... throughout my training that cut was so popular, I must've done 100’s of them and I still love it now!</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>If i could cut anyones hair it would be Isla Fisher. I love her style, colour and cut.</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you go about creating your cutting/colour styles? Is it difficult to think up new ideas and keep up with the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>Thinking up new ideas is a lot easier than you think, all it takes is a small bit of inspiration. All the team at Jakata feed each other new ideas all the time. Also <em>YouTube</em> is amazing for style ideas too.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>The secret to a good hair cut is a good listener. The best thing I ever learnt in my training was how to listen to a clients needs, the rest is easy.</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Tips for a up and coming stylist are to become a sponge, take every opportunity to learn, any courses you can get yourself on or any shadowing do it now!! Take advantage picking the brains of hairdressers.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>Jakata is totally different to any other salon. Our laid back atmosphere makes all clients feel at ease and I love the environment we work in. We have the right balance of professionalism and fun.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>The best thing for me about Jakata is the staff! I get on so well with everyone and we are such a close team. The clients that we get vary so it keeps my day interesting too.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think is the most exciting new spring/summer 2012 hair trend?</dt>
	<dd>My spring summer trend this year is Isla Fisher meets Fern Cotton for me. Rich amazing tones with a mid length, wavey textured hair cut is perfect this year.</dd>
		
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>My favourite products are the <a href="http://www.catwalkbytigi.com/the-catwalk-collection/styling-collection/session-series-styling-collection" target="_blank">Tigi Catwalk Session Series</a>. There isn’t one I don’t love! They're versatile and very current.</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you have a signature hairstyle? If so, describe it.</dt>
	<dd>I don’t think I really have a signature hair style to be honest, I really enjoy hair up styling though</dd>
	
	<dt>What pushes your buttons in the world of fashion, hair and beauty?</dt>
	<dd>All fashion inspires me. I personally like to find things I HATE and turn them into something I love,
		just by changing it slightly whether its a hair cut or colour.</dd>
	
	<dt>Tell me your strengths and weaknesses as a hairdresser.</dt>
	<dd>I love mens cutting, creative colouring, extensions and hair up, they are all my strengths. My weakness is cutting kids hair!!</dd>

<p class="offer">Many thanks to Nat for answering these questions for us so candidly.</p>

<h2>Get to know the team: Meet Shelly</h2>
<p>This month we're continuing our 'Meet the Team' series with a question and answer session with Jakata senior stylist Michelle French.</p>
<p>Michelle (AKA Shelly) gives an insight into what makes her tick as a hairdresser, what inspires her and her experiences working with Jakata</p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<dl>
	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for?</dt>
	<dd>Ive been a hairdresser for over 10 years now.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I've been at Jakata since September 2011 so I'm a relative newbie!</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I've always enjoyed experimenting and playing around with hair from being very young. I applied for an apprentice position in 2002 where I trained with Jo Mahoney (who now works at our sister salon 'Paul Kemp Hairdressing')</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>I originally started a childcare qualification. I left after a year as it didn't live up to my expectations.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>There is such a wide range of personalities, influences and hairdressing styles and techniques within the salon. The apprentices pick up a vast array of skills and knowledge from us all as a whole.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>The Graduated Bob. It will never go out of style and there are many ways to change and tailor the basic shape to suit most clients. I enjoy the precision of the cut and love to see it taking shape throughout the blow-dry.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Eddie Vedder (lead singer of Pearl Jam) I'd love him to serenade me while I'm cutting his hair, plus he's gorgeous!!</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you go about creating your cutting/colour styles? Is it difficult to think up new ideas and keep up with the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>First I assess what my client wants to achieve, what is suitable and what will work with their hair type, texture and face shape. I then determine the best shape to suit and then use modern cutting and texturising techniques to to create the updated look. I take a similar approach with colour, looking at skin tone and determining the best techniques to compliment the cut.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Correct assessment of hair type, texture, suitability and manageability. Precision cutting combined with perfect texturising plus suitable aftercare advice and products so the style can easily be recreated and maintained.</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Shadowing stylists in a busy salon will give you far more knowledge than submerging yourself in text books. Never be afraid of asking questions and always remember, no matter how much experience you have, there is always something new to learn.</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>Myself and a few friends gave someone we knew a full makeover, including hair,wardrobe and make-up after she lost her mum and split from her partner. She loved the transformation and seeing her back to her usual happy and confident self was the most rewarding payment I have ever received.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>The fun, laid back atmosphere. The element of professionalism is still there but it's the right balance. I worked for a while in another town centre salon who's focus was purely on professionalism and customer service but It wasn't until I started at Jakata I realised how It lacked the personal touches which meant the salon lacked life and atmosphere. Jakata still has the same focus on client care but there is much more warmth and friendliness.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>The creative focus of the staff rubs off on each other and the friendly but competitive personalities means we are constantly building and growing as a team and pushing things forward.</dd>
	
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>I'm a big fan of Schwarzkopf Osis 'Shape Shifters'. They come in three different strength and hold factors, which make it a very versatile product suitable for very hair type. They are great for applying to wet hair and blow drying in for strong hold. They are also great on dry hair to create texture with hold. I also love using them on my male clients to give strong definition. My favourite overall product range is Tigi Bedhead. The eye-catching packaging along with the sweet, fruity scents are a favourite among clients too. The range has a lot to offer from strong, matt creams to intensely volumizing and shine enhancing blow dry lotions</dd>

<h2>Get to know the team: Meet Laura</h2>
<p>Every month we're going to have a question and answer session with each of our team members.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for?</dt>
	<dd>Ive been hairdressing for 8 years now.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I joined back in July 2005.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I always knew I wanted to be a hairdresser probably from the age of about 4! I went to South Trafford college in Altrincham and worked as a junior at Rods in Stockton Heath.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>I would like to have been a holiday rep. Other than that I always knew I wanted to be a hairdresser.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>We are always sent on courses and lots of in house training to continually develop our skills. New starters start in the salon from scratch which soon develops them into doing things the Jakata way.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>Audrey Hepburn's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' style because its a classic that will never be out of fashion.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Gerard Butler or Johnny Depp, just because they are beautiful. Emma Watson too, because I would have loved to have been the first to chop her mega hair from Harry Potter into the gorgeous little pixie style she now has.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Theres no real secret as long as you have the right core skills and the client has the right products that you recommended to them. The only reason a client says that they can't get the same result when they do their hair themselves is because they haven't got the right products for the job - also an amazing hairdresser!!</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Offering amazing customer service is key to being a successful stylist. Plus <strong>never</strong> ask the question "same again?"</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>I get satisfaction from doing most of my clients hair. I love doing Opti-Smooth and extensions because you dramatically change the look of your client, I love doing ombre colour techniques too, they look great and are a really creative technique.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>The atmosphere, the competition work plus I think our team is strong. Clients know how well we work together, our customer service is excellent. Its hard to pin point one thing but we offer so much more and bend over backwards to accommodate.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>The people I work with! I love them all, and love working with them. I love the atmosphere, its laid back but still highly professional. I think we have a great team, we work well together.</dd>
	
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>I love Tigi, especially the 'Candy Fixations' range, because they smell amazing and you can create any hairstyle with them.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite part of hairdressing?</dt>
	<dd>I love doing hair up, if I could do it all day every day I would! Also extensions, Opti-Smooth and Kebelo.</dd>

<p>This years autumn hair colours are all about finding the perfect shade to suit your skin tone along with inventive colour placement that can enhance the overall look of your colour.</p>
<p>It’s the season of the soft and natural. Subtle highlights, soft dip dies and rich chocolate tones.</p>
<p>If you're precious about your blonde, and the thought of going darker is a no no, try adding a few biscuit or caramel tones beneath your parting to soften off and update your look for autumn.</p>
<p>As ever this time of year, rich browns, auburn and copper hues are all on trend. For the ultimate healthy shine, try a blend of two or three shades of your chosen tones overlaying each other to mix things up.</p>
<p><em>The key to maintaining your new colour is to always use a good colour save shampoo and conditioner to ensure your colour will last.</em></p>
<p><strong>We recommend the Schwarzkopf Colour Freeze range to maintain your colour for ultimate longevity.</strong></p>

<p>Shell was admitted to hospital eleven weeks ago after it was discovered she had blood poisoning. It all happened so quickly that it came as a massive shock to the team. Things got so serious with her condition that at one point we were told to prepare for the worst. She fought through but remained in a coma for a few weeks - over a period of time she started to come round and is now making a steady recovery.</p>
<p><em>We're all wishing her the best here at Jakata - our camping trips aren't the same without her!!</em></p>

<h2>New in Salon service:<br>
<em>Schwarzkopf Igora Fashion Lights</em></h2>
<p>The latest addition to our colour range arrived in the salon a few weeks ago geared at helping us to 'unleash our colour creativity'. It's NEW Fashion Lights.</p>
<p>The range aims to give breathtaking brightness and superb luminosity; providing colour and lift in one step. It gives intense vibrancy; even on dark or tinted hair.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<p><em>Schwarzkopf</em> claim that the colours are
'precise, vibrant and long lasting'. We've not had them long enough to know how long they last but we can definitely confirm that they're ultra vibrant!</p>
<p>The colours help you to individualise and emphasise your style
by achieving a variety of fashion effects. Whether you’re looking for soft and subtle highlights or more of a strong fashion statement, this range can be tailored to suit you and your individual style. Perfect for layered and choppy styles to provide intense texture, alternatively can be placed underneath to give a subtle contrast.</p>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>The colour cream is packed with intense colour cremeboosters for incredibly vibrant highlights.
The new developer contains more than 15% caring oil to provide superior hair condition and suppleness.
Colour boosters guarantee ultimate colour intensity, penetrating effectively into the hair delivering great tone luminosity, vibrancy and long lasting results.
The new oil developer carefully coats the hair, sealing the pigments inside, providing care as well as intense shine.</p>
<p><em>We've all been having fun experimenting with the different tones in the salon - give us a few more weeks and you'll start to see everything from obvious, stand out, vibrant shades to subtle subdued hues.</em></p>

<h2>The Award Winning Kebelo System just got better!</h2>
<p>We launched the <em>Kebelo System</em> in the salon a good few months ago (see earlier article)</p>
<p>We've grown to absolutely love it. The smoothing and de-frizzing results have been great every time. The obvious downsides to the treatment was the time it took to do (about 3 1/2 - 4 hours!) which in turn meant it came with a high price (close to £200) although everyone who's had it still said was worth every penny.</p>
<p><strong>Things changed earlier this month with a reformulated version of the product was launched.....</strong></p>

<p><iframe width="300" height="200" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FYPvkP2cois" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="right"></iframe></p>
<p>The new version has a reduced application time (down to 1 hour) whilst still promising to produce the same results as it's predecessor - almost hard to believe but I can safely say it's 100% true! (I've had both versions done on my hair!)</p>
<p>This is fantastic news as it means we've been able to reduce the treatment price down to <strong>just £99!</strong> (this still includes the take home aftercare pack worth £40) plus you can use that extra time (and money) doing something more productive (like shopping!)</p> 
<p><em>So there are absolutely no downsides now to the Kebelo Treatment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Plus for a limited time we're offering a FREE Cut, Dry and Style with every treatment!</strong></p>
