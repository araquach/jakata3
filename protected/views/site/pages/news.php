<h2>Get to know the team: Meet Maisie</h2>
<p>This month we caught up with Jakata's newest stylist Maisie Thompson who joined us last October.</p>
<p>We bombarded her with loads of questions about her role as a Jakata stylist.</p>
<p>Click below to read the full interview &hellip; </p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<dl>
	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for Maisie?</dt>
	<dd>I've been hairdressing for 8 years now.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I'm the newest member of the team. I only joined in October 2012.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>From a very young age I used to use tin foil to foil my girls world's hair with paint and practice plaits on all my 3 sisters. My first hairdressing job was at MC2 hair design in Stockton Heath.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>I think I would've been a nail technician.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>The very friendly relaxed environment allows us to home in on our talents and then expand them and encourage them to pass on to other members of staff.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>I just love anything with bounce and attitude!</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Michelle Keegan - because her hairs too long and its not fair. Haha</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you go about creating your cutting/colour styles? Is it difficult to think up new ideas and keep up with the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>Always listen to the client then take what they have said into consideration and advise them on what your thinking or use their ideas and incorporate some of your own. I think its very important that you always listen properly to your client so you know exactly what they like and don’t like before you share your ideas with them. Reading a lot of the hairdressing magazines and keeping up with the trends help, then putting your own little twist on them. Also going on courses to give you inspiration helps.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Precision, creativity and a strong understanding of the clients hair.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's the worst mistake you've made while cutting/colouring someone's hair?</dt>
	<dd>The worst thing that happened was when a used a toner which grabbed on the ends of porous hair. I used my colour correction knowledge and deep cleaned it - it came straight out, but I was a little worried for a minute!</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Make sure you're really passionate about being a hairdresser and have patience. Keep up to date with all the trends and don’t shy away from getting stuck in there or you will never learn. Its the best way to build up your confidence.</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>I had a client that came in that had been travelling for 12 months. She hadn’t been having her hair cut or coloured or looking after it properly. It was seriously matted and had been abused by the salt water and sun. The ends had snapped so her hair was different lengths. I cut it into a bob, put a treatment on and sorted her colour out. She went away looking like a different person (for the better).</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>Its an award winning salon with a fresh young vibe. The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>I feel like I can be more creative and adventurous because the salon has that kind of vibe. I also feel proud to be a part of an award winning salon. They encourage your passion by letting you take part in competitions and photoshoots.</dd>
	
	<dt>What thought process do you go through when styling someone for a photo shoot?</dt>
	<dd>I try to consider the overall image, making sure everything works and fits into place. Using mood boards helps pull the ideas together.</dd>
		
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>Tigi Bed Head has a great range of products to achieve different finishing looks. I think the look of them fits in really well with the salon too. They all smell amazing, so it feels like a luxury product to use.</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you have a signature hairstyle? If so, describe it.</dt>
	<dd>I like big, messy, tussled hair. Nothing too sleek and perfect, a bit ruffled. A kind of beach effect look.</dd>
	
	<dt>Tell me your strengths and weaknesses as a hairdresser.</dt>
	<dd>I'd say colour correction as a big strength, fixing other hairdressers mistakes! (from other salons not Jakata). I took part in a 12 month course that specialised in colour correction and received my certificate in Paris. I guess I just love colouring in general. I'm not as keen on doing men's hair e.g clipper work. I guess I prefer working with longer hair (there's more to play with!)</dd>

<h2>New BC Fibre Force</h2>
<p>We've all been guilty of mistreating our hair from time to time, whether it's through over straightening, over colouring or just using poor quality products. Hair is tough, but you do have to treat it right if you want it to behave itself!</p>
<p>Schwarzkopf realised there are a lot of people out there not giving their hair the love and care it needs, so they introduced BC Fibre Force - a complete range of products designed to return your hair to it's former glory over a short(ish) period of time.</p>

<h2>Get to know the team: Meet Natalie</h2>

<p>We found out how she got into hairdressing, her strengths and weaknesses plus her favourite hairdressing looks for Spring and Summer</p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>

<section class="hidden">
<dl>
	<dt>So Natalie, how long have you been hairdressing for now?</dt>
	<dd>I've been a qualified hairdresser for about 2 years now but I've been doing it for about 5 years altogether.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I joined the Jakata team back in October 2008 as Saturday staff and continued to do all my training in house.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I have always found the hair and beauty industry fascinating, so I got myself an apprenticeship with Jakata and never looked back. </dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>If I was to do any other job I would be an events organiser, I love planning and co-ordinating things.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>Jakata is amazing for developing new stylists as they really focus on your weaknesses and polish every last skill up to a high standard. It was such an amazing environment to learn in and an even better one now being on the shop floor full time.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>I absolutely love all styles, but for me the most iconic is Frankie Sandford from the Saturdays ... throughout my training that cut was so popular, I must've done 100’s of them and I still love it now!</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>If i could cut anyones hair it would be Isla Fisher. I love her style, colour and cut.</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you go about creating your cutting/colour styles? Is it difficult to think up new ideas and keep up with the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>Thinking up new ideas is a lot easier than you think, all it takes is a small bit of inspiration. All the team at Jakata feed each other new ideas all the time. Also <em>YouTube</em> is amazing for style ideas too.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>The secret to a good hair cut is a good listener. The best thing I ever learnt in my training was how to listen to a clients needs, the rest is easy.</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Tips for a up and coming stylist are to become a sponge, take every opportunity to learn, any courses you can get yourself on or any shadowing do it now!! Take advantage picking the brains of hairdressers.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>Jakata is totally different to any other salon. Our laid back atmosphere makes all clients feel at ease and I love the environment we work in. We have the right balance of professionalism and fun.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>The best thing for me about Jakata is the staff! I get on so well with everyone and we are such a close team. The clients that we get vary so it keeps my day interesting too.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think is the most exciting new spring/summer 2013 hair trend?</dt>
	<dd>My spring summer trend this year is Isla Fisher meets Fern Cotton for me. Rich amazing tones with a mid length, wavy textured hair cut is perfect this year.</dd>
		
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>My favourite products are the <a href="http://www.catwalkbytigi.com/the-catwalk-collection/styling-collection/session-series-styling-collection" target="_blank">Tigi Catwalk Session Series</a>. There isn’t one I don’t love! They're versatile and very current.</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you have a signature hairstyle? If so, describe it.</dt>
	<dd>I don’t think I really have a signature hair style to be honest, I really enjoy hair up styling though</dd>
	
	<dt>What pushes your buttons in the world of fashion, hair and beauty?</dt>
	<dd>All fashion inspires me. I personally like to find things I HATE and turn them into something I love,
		just by changing it slightly whether its a hair cut or colour.</dd>
	
	<dt>Tell me your strengths and weaknesses as a hairdresser.</dt>
	<dd>I love mens cutting, creative colouring, extensions and hair up, they are all my strengths. My weakness is cutting kids hair!!</dd>

	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for?</dt>
	<dd>Ive been a hairdresser for over 10 years now.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I've been at Jakata since September 2011 so I'm a relative newbie!</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I've always enjoyed experimenting and playing around with hair from being very young. I applied for an apprentice position in 2002 where I trained with Jo Mahoney (who now works at our sister salon 'Paul Kemp Hairdressing')</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>I originally started a childcare qualification. I left after a year as it didn't live up to my expectations.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>There is such a wide range of personalities, influences and hairdressing styles and techniques within the salon. The apprentices pick up a vast array of skills and knowledge from us all as a whole.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>The Graduated Bob. It will never go out of style and there are many ways to change and tailor the basic shape to suit most clients. I enjoy the precision of the cut and love to see it taking shape throughout the blow-dry.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Eddie Vedder (lead singer of Pearl Jam) I'd love him to serenade me while I'm cutting his hair, plus he's gorgeous!!</dd>
	
	<dt>How do you go about creating your cutting/colour styles? Is it difficult to think up new ideas and keep up with the latest trends?</dt>
	<dd>First I assess what my client wants to achieve, what is suitable and what will work with their hair type, texture and face shape. I then determine the best shape to suit and then use modern cutting and texturising techniques to to create the updated look. I take a similar approach with colour, looking at skin tone and determining the best techniques to compliment the cut.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Correct assessment of hair type, texture, suitability and manageability. Precision cutting combined with perfect texturising plus suitable aftercare advice and products so the style can easily be recreated and maintained.</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Shadowing stylists in a busy salon will give you far more knowledge than submerging yourself in text books. Never be afraid of asking questions and always remember, no matter how much experience you have, there is always something new to learn.</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>Myself and a few friends gave someone we knew a full makeover, including hair,wardrobe and make-up after she lost her mum and split from her partner. She loved the transformation and seeing her back to her usual happy and confident self was the most rewarding payment I have ever received.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>The fun, laid back atmosphere. The element of professionalism is still there but it's the right balance. I worked for a while in another town centre salon who's focus was purely on professionalism and customer service but It wasn't until I started at Jakata I realised how It lacked the personal touches which meant the salon lacked life and atmosphere. Jakata still has the same focus on client care but there is much more warmth and friendliness.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>The creative focus of the staff rubs off on each other and the friendly but competitive personalities means we are constantly building and growing as a team and pushing things forward.</dd>
	
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>I'm a big fan of Schwarzkopf Osis 'Shape Shifters'. They come in three different strength and hold factors, which make it a very versatile product suitable for very hair type. They are great for applying to wet hair and blow drying in for strong hold. They are also great on dry hair to create texture with hold. I also love using them on my male clients to give strong definition. My favourite overall product range is Tigi Bedhead. The eye-catching packaging along with the sweet, fruity scents are a favourite among clients too. The range has a lot to offer from strong, matt creams to intensely volumizing and shine enhancing blow dry lotions</dd>

	<dt>How long have you been hairdressing for?</dt>
	<dd>Ive been hairdressing for 8 years now.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you join the Jakata team?</dt>
	<dd>I joined back in July 2005.</dd>
	
	<dt>When did you first realise you wanted to become a hairdresser and where did you start?</dt>
	<dd>I always knew I wanted to be a hairdresser probably from the age of about 4! I went to South Trafford college in Altrincham and worked as a junior at Rods in Stockton Heath.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you had chosen another profession what would it have been?</dt>
	<dd>I would like to have been a holiday rep. Other than that I always knew I wanted to be a hairdresser.</dd>
	
	<dt>What key points make Jakata good at developing new stylists?</dt>
	<dd>We are always sent on courses and lots of in house training to continually develop our skills. New starters start in the salon from scratch which soon develops them into doing things the Jakata way.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite hairstyle of all time and why?</dt>
	<dd>Audrey Hepburn's 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' style because its a classic that will never be out of fashion.</dd>
	
	<dt>If you could cut anyone's hair who would it be and why?</dt>
	<dd>Gerard Butler or Johnny Depp, just because they are beautiful. Emma Watson too, because I would have loved to have been the first to chop her mega hair from Harry Potter into the gorgeous little pixie style she now has.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the secret to a good haircut/style?</dt>
	<dd>Theres no real secret as long as you have the right core skills and the client has the right products that you recommended to them. The only reason a client says that they can't get the same result when they do their hair themselves is because they haven't got the right products for the job - also an amazing hairdresser!!</dd>
	
	<dt>What tips can you give to up and coming hairstylists?</dt>
	<dd>Offering amazing customer service is key to being a successful stylist. Plus <strong>never</strong> ask the question "same again?"</dd>
	
	<dt>Can you describe a particular makeover that gave you the most satisfaction?</dt>
	<dd>I get satisfaction from doing most of my clients hair. I love doing Opti-Smooth and extensions because you dramatically change the look of your client, I love doing ombre colour techniques too, they look great and are a really creative technique.</dd>
	
	<dt>What do you think sets Jakata apart from other salons?</dt>
	<dd>The atmosphere, the competition work plus I think our team is strong. Clients know how well we work together, our customer service is excellent. Its hard to pin point one thing but we offer so much more and bend over backwards to accommodate.</dd>
	
	<dt>Whats the best thing for you about being a stylist at Jakata?</dt>
	<dd>The people I work with! I love them all, and love working with them. I love the atmosphere, its laid back but still highly professional. I think we have a great team, we work well together.</dd>
	
	<dt>Out of the product ranges which is your favourite and why?</dt>
	<dd>I love Tigi, especially the 'Candy Fixations' range, because they smell amazing and you can create any hairstyle with them.</dd>
	
	<dt>What's your favourite part of hairdressing?</dt>
	<dd>I love doing hair up, if I could do it all day every day I would! Also extensions, Opti-Smooth and Kebelo.</dd>

<p>This years autumn hair colours are all about finding the perfect shade to suit your skin tone along with inventive colour placement that can enhance the overall look of your colour.</p>
<p>It’s the season of the soft and natural. Subtle highlights, soft dip dies and rich chocolate tones.</p>
<p>If you're precious about your blonde, and the thought of going darker is a no no, try adding a few biscuit or caramel tones beneath your parting to soften off and update your look for autumn.</p>
<p>As ever this time of year, rich browns, auburn and copper hues are all on trend. For the ultimate healthy shine, try a blend of two or three shades of your chosen tones overlaying each other to mix things up.</p>
<p><em>The key to maintaining your new colour is to always use a good colour save shampoo and conditioner to ensure your colour will last.</em></p>
<p><strong>We recommend the Schwarzkopf Colour Freeze range to maintain your colour for ultimate longevity.</strong></p>
