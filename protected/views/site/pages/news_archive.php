 <h2>Daniel Anderson Hairdressing Now at Jakata</h2>
 <p>After weeks of speculation, we can now confirm that <em>Daniel Anderson</em> has joined <em>Jakata &amp; Paul Kemp Hairdressing</em>.
  	Adam and Danny have been in recent discussions to finalise the move which had to be kept under wraps until all the details were confirmed. Danny's Winwick Street salon closed last week and the task of making sure the transition was as smooth as possible was implemented. Dan and team members are now located between Jakata (Bridge Street) and Paul Kemp Hairdressing (Sankey Street).</p>

  	<h2>NEW Bedhead 'Candy Fixations'</h2>

<h2>Battle of the Oils</h2>
<p>Over the last year or so there has been an influx of Hair oils hitting the market, all offering similar claims of intense conditioning for maximum shine without weighing your hair down (the old style oil treatments left you feeling like you'd had your head dunked in a chip pan!). There are a number of brands that you might recognise: Moroccan Oil, Argan Oil, Mythic Oil etc.
  Last year saw the launch of Schwarzkopf's 'Oil Miracle' and more recently Tigi S Factor's 'True Lasting Color Hair Oil'. We have both these products in the salon (both of which are popular favourites amongst the staff) but which one is better?</p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>

<h3>Schwarzkopf Oil Miracle:</h3>
<p><iframe width="300" height="200" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6f7oj7mtuk8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="right"></iframe></p>
<p>Opulent Shine. Zero Gravity.</p>
<p>BC Oil Miracle Finishing Treatments are everything a hair oil should be, without overburdening.</p>
  
     
 <h4>Technology</h4>
 
 <p>The unique Evaporating Technology used in the BC Oil Miracle Finishing Treatments allows an even spreading of the product for opulent shine and caressable softness without leaving residues on the hair or overburdening it.
 It is composed of a carrier oil and a precious botanical oil. The carrier oil spreads extremely finely, ensuring that the precious botanical oil is dispersed in a very fine layer – then evaporates while drying. Only the precious oil is left in an ultra-light layer on the hair.</p>
 
 
 <h4>The Results</h4>
  
 <ul>
 	<li>Weightless smoothing</li>
 	<li>Opulent shine</li>
 	<li>Very smooth cuticles and closed hair surface</li>
 </ul>

 <img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/newspics/tigi_oil.jpg" alt="Tigi S Factor True Lasting Colour" width="135" height="155 ">
 <hgroup>
 	<h3>S-Factor True Lasting Colour</h3>
 	<h4>Hair Oil that shines, softens &amp; seals</h4>
 </hgroup>
 <p>This dual styling and finishing oil infused with ultra-sheer micro-shine oils helps protect colour while imparting surreal shimmer.</p>
 <p>Dispense one pump into palm of hand and run through towel dried hair for smoothness and heat protection during styling. Adjust amount and application to your hair’s length and density</p>
 <p><em>Expert Tip: Finish style by applying to dry hair to smooth frizz and fly-aways.</em></p>
 <h3>The Verdict</h3>
 <p>Both Oils are perfect for prepping the hair before blow-drying. A tiny amount is applied which initially feels like it could be too oily but once applied to the hair it absorbs in - any excess evaporates away.
 They control frizz, enhance shine, speed up blow-drying time and leave the hair soft and silky.</p>
 <h4>So which ones the best?</h4>
 <p>The verdict's out on this one, the <em>Schwarzkopf</em> is a little pricier at <strong>£24.95</strong> but the 2 different options (light and normal to thick hair) offers a more tailored choice. The <em>Tigi</em> oil give great results and probably has the edge in terms of fragrance (I'm yet to find a Tigi product that doesn't smell amazing!). The lower price point will probably appeal too at <strong>under £20</strong></p>
 <p><strong>It's really just down to which brand appeals to you more.</strong></p>

<p>Jakata had hit full capacity - any one who came in on Saturdays or late nights knows how insanely busy it got! We looked at various options and ways of expanding and decided that a second branch was the answer. With Paul being at the top of his game as a stylist plus his desire to get more involved in the business side of things, it made perfect sense for him to be the figurehead of the new salon and create the opportunity to develop an exciting new hairdressing brand that fitted perfectly with his ideals.</p>
<p>All our ideas locked together perfectly and when the Sankey Street premises became available we snapped it up and started the fit out straight away. The end result: a beautiful, modern, relaxing salon that appeals to anyone who wants to chill out and be pampered.</p>
